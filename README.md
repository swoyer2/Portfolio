This is the code for my portfolio site [here](https://swoyer2.github.io/Portfolio/)

In case I ever forget,
in order to make a blog post create a .md file in the src/blog/ dir.
Then make sure to add the corresponding link and information in the src/pages/blog/Blog.tsx
Similar instructions for the projects

then just do npm run deploy

:)
